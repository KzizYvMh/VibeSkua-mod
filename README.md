# SkuaZZ

A personal fork of [VibeSkua](https://github.com/NinjaXz/VibeSkua) that fixes the problems I kept running into while botting several AQW accounts at once, plus a few quality-of-life features that came out of those fixes.

Everything else (tabbed host, army controls, scheduler, headless mode, etc.) is VibeSkua's work. See the [VibeSkua README](https://github.com/NinjaXz/VibeSkua) for the full feature list.

## Problems fixed

### Accounts falling back to the login screen after a relogin
An account would disconnect, relog fine, and a few minutes later "blink" and go back to the login screen for good. Three causes:

* **~30 relogins at once.** The "connection lost" check runs every 100 ms and the relogin only marked itself as running *after* stopping the script, which can take seconds. Every check in that window started its own relogin, and the extra ones logged the account out again after the first one succeeded. The relogin is now claimed before anything is awaited.
* **Stale connection overlay.** After a relogin the connection overlay (`mcConnDetail`) could stay on stage with its old text while the player was already in game. The "stuck on loading" check then called `Logout()` after `LoadTimeout`, which counts as an intentional logout and skips auto relogin. The overlay is ignored while the player is connected and loaded, and "has been lost" only counts when the socket is really down.
* **Relogin cancelling itself.** Logging out between relogin attempts sent the same message a manual logout sends, which cancelled the relogin in progress. Retries after a failed first attempt never happened.

### Scripts not restarting after a disconnect
When stopped by a logout, CoreBots restarts the script by itself 5 seconds later, while the account is still disconnected. The script then stopped with *"Please log-in before starting the bot"* and sat on that dialog, so the relogin's own restart got "Script already running". `RestartScriptAsync` now waits for auto relogin to bring the player back first.

### False disconnects
Transient Flash read failures (a busy Flash returning `false`) were taken as a disconnect. A disconnect now has to persist for 10 seconds before relogin triggers.

### Class Enhance button doing nothing / spamming `/join`
* Updating the scripts brings back an unpatched `CoreAdvanced.cs`, so the Enhance script failed to compile without telling anyone. The class enhance patch is now re-applied automatically before every script compile, and errors are shown.
* The enhance script returned to the map with `Map.FullName` (`battleon-3`), so CoreBots sent `/join battleon-3-<room>` in an endless retry loop. It uses `Map.Name` now.

### Local scripts missing from Search Scripts
Scripts copied into the Scripts folder by hand (third-party packs such as UltrasLW) didn't show up in Search Scripts. They are now listed under All / Local / Pinned with a "Local" tag. Update All and Download All still only touch repository scripts.

## Added along the way

* **Multiple launchers.** Open an account in a new launcher or pick one of the open launchers. Launchers can start empty and stay open with no tabs. Tabs can be moved between launchers while running, and closing a launcher with running accounts asks first.
* **Per-class enhance profiles.** In CoreBots Options › Class Enhance, each class gets its recommended enhancements, which you can override. A "Keep" option leaves a slot untouched, and an Enhance button applies the profile to the equipped class.
* **CoreBots profiles of connected accounts.** The CoreBots Options header is a dropdown with every account logged in on any open tab, so you can edit another account's options without switching tabs.
* **Script options from the Manager.** A ⚙ button next to the auto-start script opens that script's options dialog without starting a client.
* **Simpler UI.** The account toolbar only shows selection actions while accounts are checked. The script shows its name instead of the full path. Boolean options are on/off switches instead of Enabled/Disabled buttons.

## Building

There are no releases for this fork, so build it from source (.NET 10 SDK):

```cmd
BuildProject.bat
```

This compiles the client, the Manager and the plugins, and stages everything into `Build\`. Run `Build\SkuaZZ.Manager.exe`.

Manual build:

```bash
dotnet build Skua.App.Avalonia -c Release
dotnet build Skua.Manager.Avalonia -c Release
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\package-build.ps1
```

> **Note:** The Manager's updater checks [KzizYvMh/skuaziz](https://github.com/KzizYvMh/skuaziz/releases) releases.
