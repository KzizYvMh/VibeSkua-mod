# SkuaZZ
> **Note:** This project is **Vibe Coded**—built through AI-assisted development, and pure momentum.

A feature-rich, high-performance rehaul of [auqw/skua](https://github.com/auqw/skua) (v1.4.3.0), building upon the early Avalonia port by [ArrowDev](https://github.com/ArrowDev123/Skua) (BlackArrow on Discord). Upgraded with native multi-client army orchestration, headless performance, and core stability fixes.

## The Avalonia UI Rehaul (What's New in 2.0)
SkuaZZ has officially transitioned away from legacy WPF to a ground-up modern desktop architecture:

* 🎨 **Modern Fluent Avalonia Shell:** Completely redesigned from scratch using **Avalonia 11**. Features a sleek, modern dark glassmorphism theme, crisp typography, responsive layout scaling, and smooth animations.
* ⚡ **Unified Multi-Client Tabbed Host:** Native multi-client workspace (`TabbedHostWindow`) with dynamic scrollable tabs, instant 1-click tab creation, and seamless instance management without overlapping taskbar clutter.
* 🌐 **Global Army Controls:** Integrated top-bar Army Control hub (`Start All`, `Stop All`, `Load Script to All`, `Army Scheduler`, `Jump All to Map/Player`, and synchronized `Lag Killer / Headless / Hide Players` toggles).
* ⊞ **Adaptive Multi-Instance Grid View:** View and monitor entire armies simultaneously in a clean, auto-fitting single-window grid layout.

## Skua Architecture Comparison
The following overview compares the systems and core features between the legacy WPF `auqw/skua` client and SkuaZZ.

### Quality of Life & Features
| Feature | Original (Legacy WPF) | SkuaZZ (Avalonia) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UI Framework & Design** | Legacy WPF framework. | **Rebuilt in Avalonia UI.** Features sleek Fluent dark styling, smooth animations, and hardware acceleration. |
| **Account Tabs & Multi-Client** | Required running individual separate windows which clutter the screen and taskbar. | Native `TabbedHostWindow` host with dynamic SWF patching and horizontal tab bar. |
| **Army Control & Navigation** | Required managing each client independently. | Features a Script Scheduler to broadcast schedules, "Load Script to All", strict login validation, separate Map and Cell input boxes for exact room placement (`teleport across rooms inside your current map without reloading`), exact spawn/pad targeting (`e.g. Boss, Left`), a dedicated `"Jump All to Player..."` option (`instant 1-click /goto commands across all tabs`), and a robust IPC system across tabs. |
| **Smart Grid View** | Required managing dozens of overlapping individual windows. | Consolidates all active accounts into a clean, clutter-free grid inside a single window to monitor a full army at once. |
| **Headless Mode** | Full-screen rendering; high resource demand per instance. | Introduced a 1x1 hidden pixel viewport, forcing Flash to bypass geometry/blitting and significantly reducing resource consumption. |
| **Discord Integration** | Lacked native capability. | `DiscordWebhookService` integrated natively. Features rich visual embed cards (`Script Started`, `Farming Session Concluded`, `Scheduler Paused`), automatic rate-limiting (`HTTP 429`) retry loops, a threaded queue structure to prevent dropped packets, and `CachedUsername` preservation so webhooks and script status alerts always display your character's real username after disconnections. |
| **Script Scheduling** | Required manual initialization and supervision with static script options. | Added autonomous script queuing with independent option profiles, custom display names, save/load playlist states, `SilentConfig` unattended execution (`popup modal windows automatically suppressed so overnight farming never stalls`), smart auto-relogin collision protection (`resumption recognition prevents skipped items when reconnecting during playlists`), plain-English error unwrapping, and automatic paused state monitoring (`Scheduler Paused`). |
| **Script Repository & Sorting** | Basic navigation; crash-prone when downloading all scripts; cache sizing hides scripts. | Upgraded `ScriptRepoViewModel` with search-as-you-type filtering, category filters, and ascending/descending sorting. Fixed semaphore lifecycle crashes during "Download All" and repaired cache sizing so community scripts are never hidden. |
| **Pause Functionality** | Could only fully Stop scripts, entirely losing current progression. | Built a native `Pause` feature that safely freezes the execution thread in place, letting you interact with menus and resume later. |
| **Streamer Mode** | Basic privacy capabilities. | Actively scrubs character names, guild tags, room numbers, and disables chat via background asynchronous Flash injection. |
| **Auto-Relogin Resilience** | Basic relogin handling prone to freezing during network timeouts. | Redesigned with asynchronous task scheduling, dynamic alternative server selection, and fallback socket injection. Upgraded with staggered multi-account batch launches (`500ms–900ms stagger paired with retry jitter to prevent server rate-limiting`), an active `"Stuck on Login"` monitor (`automatic UI reset and rescue if authentication hangs above 5 seconds`), and synchronized character data buffering (`waiting for server list readiness before joining to completely eliminate "Character Data Could Not Be Loaded" errors`). |
| **Reorganized Navigation & UI** | Default top menu navigation. | Reorganized left-to-right based on workflow priority (`Scripts`, `Options`, `Tools & Helpers`, `Combat`, `Bank`, `Diagnostics`, `Plugins`). Features instant batch-loading for the Daily Tracker window, categorized daily vs. weekly ultra boss lockouts, and a unified developer diagnostics workspace (`Logs, Console, Spammer, Logger, Interceptor`). |
| **Loadouts Manager** | Non-existent or fully manual. | Fully automates item equipping and dynamic (Forge) enhancements natively via C#. Features a smart banking algorithm, missing gear alerts, and state restoration. |
| **Custom Scripts Loader** | Only supported official repository scripts. | Natively load individual local scripts or custom script directories directly into the UI, complete with safe file deletion prompts and ghost entry cleanup. |
| **Custom Hotkeys** | Relied on static, hardcoded keyboard shortcuts. | Replaced static keybinds with a dynamic cross-window `IHotKeyService` supporting global army toggles, multi-client broadcast triggers, and user-customizable bindings. |

### Performance & Engine Optimizations

* **Combat Cooldown Deadlock & Race Elimination:** Reworked Global Cooldown (`GCD`) index checks in `AdvancedSkillCommand.cs` by verifying skill readiness (`isOK` and Flash `canUseSkill`) before advancing rotation indices, completely eliminating endless Auto-Attack loops (`Only using autoattack`). Enforced a 3.5-second bounded safety ceiling in `ScriptSkill.cs` (`Wait.ForTrue`) so background threads break cleanly and trigger `OnTargetReset()` during monster death or UI lockups without deadlocking or freezing your character.
* **ActionScript 3 (SWF) Garbage Collection & Animation Protection:** Throttled Flash display tree inspection modules (`DisableFX` and `HidePlayers`) down to synchronized 2 FPS checks, cutting string allocations and Flash garbage collection overhead by over 93% to prevent overnight out-of-memory crashes. Disabled destructive animation clipping (`OptimizePlayers`) so room and character poses keep playing smoothly during map transitions, and added strict null safety checks in `RemoteRegistry.as` (`destroy()` and `ext_destroy()`) and `Player.as` (`isKicked()`) to eliminate Flash `Error #1009` crashes.
* **C# / .NET Core Concurrency & Memory Upgrades:** Added automatic Large Object Heap cache clearing for dynamic XML game queries (`getGameObject`), fast multi-file `#include` dependency preprocessing, accurate `ScriptWait` loop math (`dividing timeout arguments by 100 instead of 1000`), and thread-safe COM dispatching across UI boundaries while keeping background script threads thread-safe.
* **SWF Memory Caching:** Implemented `PreloadSwf()` in `FlashUtil.cs` to cache files directly in RAM, accelerating instance launches. Enforced `WMode="direct"` for hardware-accelerated rendering.
* **Optimized Memory Management:** Mitigated memory leaks in the Avalonia client by properly managing subscriber lifecycles on `StrongReferenceMessenger` and using WeakReference patterns, preventing slowdowns over multi-day sessions.
* **Fluid Asynchronous Operations:** Replaced blocking `Thread.Sleep` calls with non-blocking `await Task.Delay` across automated hunting loops, freeing up thread-pool resources and reducing UI micro-stutters.
* **Clean Task Lifecycles & UI Decoupling:** Overhauled background processes (like `DailyTracker` and `SingleInstanceWatcher`) to respect cancellation tokens and fully decouple heavy game-state checks from the main rendering thread.
* **Network Proxy Optimization:** Refactored `CaptureProxy.cs` to utilize `Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes()` for packet conversion, minimizing latency during high-traffic sessions.
* **GitHub Script Caching Engine:** Engineered `ScriptDates.json` to store metadata and track SHA hashes. Intelligent API querying conserves rate limits and provides graceful UI fallbacks on connection failure.
* **Background Connection Stability:** Repositions inactive clients off-screen and uses an Avalonia `DispatcherTimer` to ping the `isLoggedIn` COM interface every 500ms, preventing OS-level socket throttling.
* **Active Memory Management:** Introduced `MemoryUtils.cs` to periodically trim the application’s working set, ensuring RAM stability during long, multi-day farming sessions.
* **Asynchronous Flash Injection:** Built a background loop to actively override ActionScript 3 variables (e.g., `world.strMapName`) every 500ms to maintain privacy in Streamer Mode.
* **Velopack Deployment Architecture:** Fully migrated deployment infrastructure to Velopack. Enables 1-click silent installs, automatic desktop shortcuts, zero-install portable zip generation, and built-in background auto-updating via GitHub Releases API.
* **And Many More:** Dozens of underlying architectural, thread-safety, and runtime stability enhancements across the entire framework.
